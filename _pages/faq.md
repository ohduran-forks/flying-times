## The short version
I've been a Digital Consultant, a Data Scientist and a Software Engineer. I [don't usually respond to email](/email). I was born in Madrid, been living in London for 3 years, and I'm currently in Barcelona.

## The long version
You can find it in my [contact page](/contact), and a structured version in my [resume page](/resume)
